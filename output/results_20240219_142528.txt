CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
# This section introduces the purpose and background of the analysis.

In this analysis, we aim to evaluate the performance of different reject options for Information Treatment Effect (ITE) models.The ITE model predicts the individual treatment effects in a given dataset, providing valuable insights into the impact of interventions.

\Chapter 2: Preprocessing

# This section executes the data retrieval, preprocessing and splitting in a training and dataset.During the whole file, the used dataset is: TWINS

CHAPTER 3: Training of the ITE Model

# This section provides details about the model selection, training process, and any hyperparameter tuning.
The trained ITE model is a T-LEARNER.
The two individually trained models are: LogisticRegression

CHAPTER 4: Evaluate treated and control groups seperately

# This section evaluates the individually trained models (two as we used a T-learner).
The used performance measures are:

 - Confusion Matrix
 - Accuracy: overall correctness of the model ((TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN))
 - Precision: It measures the accuracy of positive predictions (TP / (TP + FP))
 - Recall: ability of the model to capture all the relevant cases (TP / (TP + FN))
 - F1 Score: It balances precision and recall, providing a single metric for model evaluation (2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall))
 - ROC
